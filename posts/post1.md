Who would have thought 5 years ago that today I would be writing a blog about attending the AI seminar in the master's program? It's amazing what a journey I've been on, and what a change it has brought to me. But let's start from the beginning...

### **üëã Personal Introduction**
I am married and have two children who are now 11 and 14 years old (Crazy how time flies üò±). I completed my initial training as a registered nurse, but my perspective soon shifted - from apprentice to trainer. I have always enjoyed working with trainees and providing direct patient care, but my path has taken me in a new direction. I decided to go into quality management and later into clinical research. But then came the big change: five years ago, my employer asked me if I could see a future in computer science/data science. So, I took the big step of starting my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2020 - a challenging adventure that I successfully completed last summer. The four years required not only a lot of free time and commitment, but also perseverance and patience with myself. And it was worth it - I made it ü•≥. During my studies, I discovered my enthusiasm for machine learning and artificial intelligence, which strengthened my desire to delve even deeper into this field. So I decided to do a Master's in Data Science at CAI and ZHAW. In the meantime, I have successfully completed the first semester with the first theory modules - and now, full of curiosity, I am moving on to the next semester, including the participation in this AI seminar.

### **üöÄ Motivation**
Exactly a year ago, I spent most of my time poring over scientific publications - and with good reason. My final year project for my bachelor's degree was dedicated to a comprehensive survey of the current state of the art in the field of natural language-instructed agents for computer control. Specifically, I investigated how far the development of such agents has progressed. These systems receive natural language commands and act like a human - using a mouse and keyboard. The central aspect of my work was to design the "blueprint" of such an agent. This is my motivation for attending this AI seminar.

After reading countless scientific papers of varying quality, one thing became clear to me: effective tools are needed to distinguish good work from less convincing work. But not only that - it is equally important to be able to write high quality scientific texts yourself.

The art of presentation is equally important. Research results and complex topics should not only be presented in a technically sound way, but also in an understandable and engaging way. A good paper guides the reader through the material in a structured way, while a compelling presentation holds the reader's attention and makes the relevance of the research tangible.

### **üîç Rationals for Selecting the Topic**
What is the topic that fascinates me so much that I can bring my motivation to this AI seminar and get the most out of it? The answer was immediate:

**Bayesian Deep Learning!**

Last semester I took the module Bayesian Machine Learning - a topic that fascinates me. The Bayesian approach plays a crucial role, especially in my specific context, the healthcare sector. Here, it is not only important to make predictions, but also to reliably measure their uncertainty.

In the last lecture I got a first insight into Bayesian Deep Learning. As this field still has a lot of untapped potential and is developing rapidly, I would like to delve deeper into it. At the same time, I see this as an exciting opportunity to get ideas for my upcoming Specialisation Thesis (VT) next semester.

### **üéØ Learning Goals**
By taking part in this AI seminar, I hope to optimise the following skills and abilities

**Efficient evaluation of scientific publications:**

How to quickly and reliably distinguish high quality from low quality papers?

**Improve my own scientific writing:**

What skills do I need to produce a convincing and sound publication?

**Effective presentation of scientific results:**

How to prepare complex content so that it is not only understandable but also engaging for a wide audience.

My path hasn't been straight, but that's what makes it so valuable - because each of those steps led me here: to **the master's program**, to **this AI-seminar**, and to **my interest in working with scientific precision and gaining well-founded insights** üòÉ.
