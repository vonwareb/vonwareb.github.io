Who would have thought five years ago that today I would be writing a blogpost about attending the AI seminar in the master's program? It's amazing what a journey I've been on, and what a change it has brought to me. But let's start from the beginning...

### **üëã Who Am I? A Quick Introduction**
I am married and have two children who are now 11 and 14 years old (Crazy how time flies üò±). Initially trained as a registered nurse, my perspective soon shifted‚Äîfrom apprentice to trainer. Working with trainees and providing direct patient care has always been fulfilling, yet my path led me in a different direction. I decided to go into quality management and later into clinical research. But then came the big change: five years ago, my employer asked me if I could see a future in Computer Science/Data Science. So, I took the big step of starting my bachelor in computer science in 2020 - a challenging adventure that I successfully completed last summer. The four years required not only a lot of free time and commitment, but also perseverance and patience with myself. And it was worth it - I made it ü•≥.

During my studies, I discovered my enthusiasm for machine learning and artificial intelligence, which strengthened my desire to delve deeper into the field. So I decided to do a master's in data science at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI) at ZHAW. In the meantime, I have successfully completed the first semester - and have now started the next semester full of curiosity, including participation in this AI seminar.

### **üöÄ Why I Joined This AI Seminar**
Exactly one year ago, I spent most of my time analyzing scientific publications - and for good reason. The bachelor's thesis was dedicated to a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in the field of *Natural Language-Instructed Autonomous Agent for Computer Control*. Specifically, I investigated how far the development of such agents has progressed. Such agents receive natural language commands and act like a human - using a mouse and keyboard. Designing a potential blueprint for a *Natural Language-Instructed Autonomous Agent for Computer Control* was the central aspect of our work. 

After reading countless scientific papers of varying quality, one thing has become clear: You need the right tools to distinguish good papers from the less convincing ones. But not only that - it is equally important to be able to write high quality scientific work.

Just as important is the art of presenting. Research results and complex topics should be presented in a way that is not only technically sound, but also understandable and engaging. A good paper guides the reader through the subject matter in a structured way, while a convincing presentation captures the reader's attention and illustrates the relevance of the scientific work.

All of this has encouraged me to take part in this AI seminar.

### **üîç The Reasoning Behind My Topic Choice**
But what topic fascinates me so much that I can fully contribute my motivation and get maximum value from this AI seminar? The answer came immediately:

**Bayesian Deep Learning!**

Last semester, I took the Bayesian Machine Learning module - a topic that captured my interest. The Bayesian approach plays a crucial role, especially in my specific context, the healthcare sector. Here, it is not only important to make predictions, but also to reliably measure their uncertainty.

In the last lecture I got a first insight into *Bayesian Deep Learning*. As this field still has a lot of untapped potential and is developing rapidly, I would like to delve deeper into it. At the same time, I see this as an exciting opportunity to get ideas for my upcoming specialization thesis (VT) next semester.

### **üéØ What I Hope to Learn**
By attending this AI seminar, I hope to optimize the following skills and abilities

**Efficient evaluation of scientific publications:**

*How to quickly and reliably distinguish high quality from low quality papers.*

**Improve my own scientific writing:**

*What skills do I need to produce a convincing and sound publication.*

**Effective presentation of scientific results:**

*How to prepare complex content so that it is not only understandable but also engaging for a wide audience.*

My path hasn't been straight, but that's what makes it so valuable - because each of those steps led me here: to **the master's program**, to **this AI-seminar**, and to **my interest in working with scientific precision and gaining well-founded insights** üòÉ.
