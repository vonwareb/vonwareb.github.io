Who would have thought five years ago that today I would be writing a blogpost about attending the AI seminar in the master's program? It's amazing what a journey I've been on, and what a change it has brought to me. But let's start from the beginning...

### **üëã Who Am I? A Quick Introduction**
I am married and have two children who are now 11 and 14 years old (Crazy how time flies üò±). Initially trained as a registered nurse, my perspective soon shifted‚Äîfrom apprentice to trainer. Working with trainees and providing direct patient care has always been fulfilling, yet my path led me in a different direction. I decided to go into quality management and later into clinical research. But then came the big change: five years ago, my employer asked me if I could see a future in Computer Science/Data Science. So, I took the big step of starting my bachelor in computer science in 2020 - a challenging adventure that I successfully completed last summer. The four years required not only a lot of free time and commitment, but also perseverance and patience with myself. And it was worth it - I made it ü•≥.

During my studies, I discovered my enthusiasm for machine learning and artificial intelligence, which strengthened my desire to delve deeper into the field. So I decided to do a master's in data science at the Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI) at ZHAW. In the meantime, I have successfully completed the first semester - and have now started the next semester full of curiosity, including participation in this AI seminar.

### **üöÄ Why I Joined This AI Seminar**
Exactly one year ago, I spent most of my time analyzing scientific publications - and for good reason. The bachelor's thesis was dedicated to a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in the field of *Natural Language-Instructed Autonomous Agent for Computer Control*. Specifically, I investigated how far the development of such agents has progressed. Such agents receive natural language commands and act like a human - using a mouse and keyboard. Designing a potential blueprint for a *Natural Language-Instructed Autonomous Agent for Computer Control* was the central aspect of our work. 

After reading countless scientific papers of varying quality, one thing has become clear: You need the right tools to distinguish good papers from the less convincing ones. But not only that - it is equally important to be able to write high quality scientific work.

Just as important is the art of presenting. Research results and complex topics should be presented in a way that is not only technically sound, but also understandable and engaging. A good paper guides the reader through the subject matter in a structured way, while a convincing presentation captures the reader's attention and illustrates the relevance of the scientific work.

All of this has encouraged me to take part in this AI seminar.

### **üîç The Reasoning Behind My Topic Choice**
But what topic fascinates me so much that I can fully contribute my motivation and get maximum value from this AI seminar? The answer came immediately:

**Bayesian Deep Learning!**

Last semester, I took the Bayesian Machine Learning module - a topic that captured my interest. The Bayesian approach plays a crucial role, especially in my specific context, the healthcare sector. Here, it is not only important to make predictions, but also to reliably measure their uncertainty.

In the last lecture I got a first insight into *Bayesian Deep Learning*. As this field still has a lot of untapped potential and is developing rapidly, I would like to delve deeper into it. At the same time, I see this as an exciting opportunity to get ideas for my upcoming specialization thesis (VT) next semester.

### **üéØ What I Hope to Learn**
<!-- By attending this AI seminar, I hope to optimize the following skills and abilities

**Efficient evaluation of scientific publications:**

*How to quickly and reliably distinguish high quality from low quality papers.*

**Improve my own scientific writing:**

*What skills do I need to produce a convincing and sound publication.*

**Effective presentation of scientific results:**

*How to prepare complex content so that it is not only understandable but also engaging for a wide audience.* -->

The two learning objectives that I will be pursuing during the seminar are as follows:

#### Learning Goal I
At the end of the seminar, I will have created a grid with at least five evaluation criteria for assessing the quality of scientific publications. This grid should serve as a tool for evaluating scientific texts and show what makes a good scientific text. To test its applicability, the grid will be applied to at least three scientific texts by the end of the seminar. The result will include the criteria grid, and a written evaluation of each text analyzed, taking into account the evaluation grid.


#### Learning Goal II
At the end of the seminar, I will have written a scientific paper on my chosen topic, Bayesian Deep Learning, in order to improve my scientific writing skills. In doing so, I will integrate the theoretical content of the seminar as well as independently acquired knowledge. At the end of the writing phase, a self-reflection will be conducted. This will present the process, and the theoretical concepts used. The result will be the written scientific text and a reflection paper, which should serve as a guide for the writing of further scientific texts.

My path hasn't been straight, but that's what makes it so valuable - because each of those steps led me here: to **the master's program**, to **this AI-seminar**, and to **my interest in working with scientific precision and gaining well-founded insights** üòÉ.
