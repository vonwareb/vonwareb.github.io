The blog series about the AI seminar began with a personal post about my journey to the seminar. After several technical posts about my chosen topic, *Bayesian deep learning*, it will conclude with another personal post.
In this final post, I take an honest look back at how I have moved forward. What have I learned? In which areas have I grown, and where is there room for improvement? It is a reflection on my performance, progress and the challenges I faced along the way.

### **üìö What I (Did and Did not) Learn**
Looking back at the start of the AI seminar, I realize that I have improved in some areas thanks to it. This improvement applies not only to reading and categorizing scientific papers, but also to my ability to write (I really enjoyed writing blog posts for the first time üòÉ)  and to present my knowledge in an understandable way. But first things first...

### **üëì Can I Read and Understand a Scientific Paper?**
Reading scientific papers? That is a real challenge!
But with the right strategies and a little practice, it is manageable. Fortunately, I could draw on my experience writing my bachelor's thesis, when I read over 200 papers. What really helped me in the seminar, though, was the fine-tuning: practical tips on how to efficiently assess the relevance of a paper and how deeply to read it.

I now pay more attention to things like:

* Is it a preprint, journal, or conference paper?
* How many citations does it have, and how established is the author (keyword: h-index)?
* Does the title clearly indicate its relevance to my topic?

Of course, there is also the tried-and-true shortcut. I almost always start with the abstract, introduction, and conclusion. If these sections are substantial, it is worth taking a deeper look at the methodology and results.

Thanks to this approach, I can now easily understand complex scientific texts and draw specific conclusions from them. I get lost in the details much less often now.

### **üîç Can I Find and Evaluate Relevant Literature?**

I learned a lot about literature research at the AI seminar. This was largely due to the variety of tools presented. I was rather sceptical at first. I preferred to stick to my usual method of using Google Scholar. After all, it has always worked.

However, after testing the assigned tool, I realized the potential of these new approaches. The search for relevant literature was not only faster, but also more targeted. I could find and compare relevant papers more easily and recognize thematic connections more quickly.

In the end, I tried five of the suggested tools. I now regularly use three of them: *Elicit*, *Connected Papers*, and *ResearchRabbit*. These tools help me access literature faster and in a more structured way.

What have I learned? It is worth questioning ingrained habits.

### **üåê Can I Put Research in Context?**

Over the past few weeks, I have been working intensively on the topic of *Bayesian deep learning*. I have read and analyzed several papers on the subject, attempting to relate them to the broader topic. In doing so, I realized that there is rarely only one way to describe a topic or method, and sometimes they contradict each other.

Through critical comparison, classification, and conscious identification of similarities, I improved my ability to view research in context. I learned not to read every paper in isolation.

Again, do not get lost in the details. The goal is not to understand every formula, but to recognize the message of a paper in its overall context. This has changed my perspective. From *absorbing knowledge* to *understanding how knowledge is interconnected*.

### **üß† Can I Form My Own Scientific Opinion?**

Questioning or even contradicting a statement from a paper is not easy. In my view, it requires a solid foundation of subject-specific knowledge and confidence in its own judgment.

With regard to *Bayesian deep learning*, I have since acquired a solid foundational knowledge. Nevertheless, I recognize that it remains rather challenging for me to substantiate or refute a statement scientifically. This is not necessarily because I lack the knowledge, but rather because I sometimes lack the self-confidence to clearly defend it.

I think there is still a lot of potential for me here. In light of my upcoming project works, it is a skill I definitely want to develop further.

### **üó£Ô∏è Can I Present Scientific Results in Different Ways?**

Presenting? I really enjoy it, especially when I can inform and entertain at the same time. A short joke or little surprise helps me engage the audience. At the same time, it is important to me to be technically sound and understandable. I feel most comfortable presenting in German, my native language.

It is a different story when I am required to present in English. I still often lack that *at home* feeling. However, I have noticed that it improves with each presentation. My goal is to give convincing and engaging presentations in the future, regardless of the language (whether German or English)

It is similar with writing. Blog posts came surprisingly easily to me. Scientific writing, on the other hand, is a completely different challenge. Although I only had to write the final survey in a formal style for the seminar, I learned a lot from the discussions about paper structure and content. I will carry these insights with me for the next scientific papers that are sure to come.

### **üí¨ Can I Engage in Scientific Discussions?**

For me, scientific discussions are often an internal balancing act. If I am unsure about a topic, I prefer to hold back. Even when I am confident about a subject, I sometimes overthink whether I should contribute.

However, over the course of the AI seminar, I noticed that I became increasingly active. Nevertheless, I see a lot of potential for improvement. It is better to risk making a wrong or confusing statement than to remain silent.

### ü§ù **How Do I Compare to and Learn from My Peers?**

In this AI seminar group, it is difficult to identify clear differences in terms of *who was better*. They were informative and pleasant to read, sometimes even entertaining. Of course, some posts had more depth than others, but the overall standard was very high. And yes, I definitely include my own posts in this assessment. I put a lot of thought into the writing process. I considered what was truly relevant and aimed to present the content in a way that was not only technically accurate but also appealing. Perhaps that was a small plus point, at least in terms of clarity and structure.

During the presentations, however, I was impressed by how relaxed and confident some of my classmates were. I need a lot more preparation and practice. Is that a disadvantage? Not necessarily. Structured practice helps me build my content clearly, even if it seems less spontaneous.

The inspiration was found in the active participation of my fellow students in the discussions. This is exactly the kind of engagement that motivates me. I enjoy getting involved in discussions, asking questions, and reflecting.

### **üéØ Final Thoughts**

The AI seminar helped me both professionally and personally. I learned to better understand, evaluate, and communicate scientific content. I achieved this in various ways. Whether it was in the form of a blog post, a presentation, or a discussion.

The most important lesson I learned is that science thrives on exchange, even when you are not 100% sure.

I am taking away many useful tips and tricks for my future scientific work, and I look forward to applying them soon.
